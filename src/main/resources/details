Iteration 1 = Tight coupled we have to comment and call the instance of the class it gives compile tym error
create project using spring intitializer
create class mario, supercontra, pacman
create runner class to call gaming classes
create constructor and in param just give the var name
create variable of gaming class and make it private
create instance of classes
create instance of runner class

Iteration 2 = Loose coupling using Interface
create automated interface GamingConsole
implement interface by every class
create variable of Interface and pass it to param
just comment and call the required instance of the class
Has all the classes implementing Interface so all has same functionality so we can call anyone of them simply run the instance of required class

Iteration 3 = Loose coupling using Spring
@Component annotation used on gaming classes and GameRunner class
@Autowired to merged and create a instance of GameRunner class to call gaming classes
just change the @ Component from one class to another
It will create the instance of that class automatically
add a local variable for SpringApplication.run statement in ApplicationContext
create GameRunner class object and call the ApplicationContext object through which we can getBeans and pass the param of the Application class
i.e GameRunner.class
and comment all the object that is created for gaming class
